# Test Tree Pagination

This sample shows how to list 100 items at a time in a tree view. When the "Load more items" button is clicked at the end of the list, 100 more
items are "loaded" and added to the end of the list.

This concept can apply at any level of the tree view, but was done at the root level for demonstration purposes.

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View
